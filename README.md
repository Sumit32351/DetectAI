# What is detectAI ? 

DetectAI is a open-source tool designed to detect AI generated content on StackOverflow.

It uses CodeBERT in the background to predict AI generated code. 

# Installation

1. Go to your google chrome browser and paste the following address :  ```https://github.com/harsh-g1/DetectAI```

2. Download the zip folder from the CODE button on top right side.

3. Unzip the folder.


# LOADING THE EXTENSION

1. >Go to chrome://extensions/

2. Enable developer mode.

3. Go to the folder where you unzipped the downloaded folder(say we named it DetectAI). Go into this folder, where we will see multiple folder like backend, extensions etc. Choose the extension folder and load it.

# HOW TO USE 

### ACTIVATING THE LOCALHOST

1. Go to the terminal and add the path where the folder is downloaded. 

2. Run this once to download and save the model
```bash
    mkdir -p models/codebert
    python3 -c "
    from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer
    model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('microsoft/codebert-base')
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('microsoft/codebert-base')
    model.save_pretrained('./models/codebert')
    tokenizer.save_pretrained('./models/codebert')
    "
```

2. Type 
```bash
    cd backend
```

3. Activate the model with 
```bash
    python3 app.py
```
   This activates the flask server. Now the model is ready to receive requests.


### USING THE EXTENSION

1. Go to Stack Overflow and locate any page that has some code. Then on the top right, click on the extensions icon. Then select DetectAI. Then a popup comes form which we can select Analyse button.

2. We will see the results on the top of each answer's code section.
